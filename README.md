Si Penjaga Sungai 


is a project by 2 students developing a river cleaning autonomous robot to mantain and prevent flooding
Main features include trash mapping and pickup.









Many codes will be sourced and compiled to make a complete and adjusted need for our objectives.


FOR TRAINING WE SUGGEST USE OF PYTHON 3.9 or LOWER for easier use and for inference use 3.11 
We also suggest to train with enough computing power possibly GPU support.
Any port, model path, and IP for RTC needed further configuration. 
Several Python libraries used include :
opencv-python-headless(client and server),tflite(server),tflite-model-maker(server),aiohttp and aiortc(client and server).
Feel free to make improvements and ajdustment as necessary.
